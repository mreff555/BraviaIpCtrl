# BraviaIpCtrl
An API for interfacing with Sony Bravia devices

This project is still evolving, and of course welcoming all creative input.  Here are the current potential milestones:

- Implement all functionality defined in in the command definitions
- Implement validition for all functionality.
- compile API code as a shared object.
- Add additional functionality as seperate executibles.  Possible implementations include:
  * Command line interface (a debugging CLI was temporarily implemented in the main function)
  * Various GUI remotes.
  * Schedulers

- Command Definitions
